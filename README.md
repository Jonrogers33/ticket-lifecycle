Next, we logged in to our service desk. The original ticket was not assigned and the SLA was not indicated. While logged in as the service desk we can see the ticket properties and modify. Due to the severty of the ticket, SLA was set to SEV-A, assigned to proper department - online banking, and change the help topic to reflect appropriate issue.

The ticket is created by the end user and our service desk assigned this ticket to online banking department. The helpdesk professional within Online Banking department - Jane has received the ticket, assigned it to herself, and performed necessary steps for resolution. After resolving the issue causing the problem Jane posted updates informing all parties and closed the ticket. This screenshot shows the birdseye view of Jane resolving ticket and closing said ticket.
